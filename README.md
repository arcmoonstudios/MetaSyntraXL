# MetaSyntraXL

MetaSyntraXL is a comprehensive, production-ready AI framework designed to integrate advanced components such as Transformer models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Bayesian Networks for neuro-symbolic reasoning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for reinforcement learning, and ensemble methods to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Transformer-RAG Module:** Enhances language understanding and generation with contextually relevant data retrieval.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning:** Utilizes Bayesian Networks for logical inference and validation.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Implements PPO within Cognitive Thought Entities for adaptive decision-making.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combines multiple models using Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking for improved performance.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Maintains structured relationships and supports semantic search.
- **Gradient-Based Semantic Caching:** Optimizes training efficiency with an LRU cache mechanism.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
- **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Facilitates debugging and monitoring with detailed logs.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust:** Ensure Rust is installed. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Docker:** For containerization and deployment. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Elasticsearch:** Used for the retrieval system.
- **Prometheus & Grafana:** For monitoring and visualization.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArcMoonStudios/metasyntraxl.git
   cd metasyntraxl
